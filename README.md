This program is simple implementation of auto thresholding in image
Threshold is the minimum value of pixel, above threshold value we are replacing its intensity value with 1 and below we are replaing with 0.
It means we are creating a binary image. 
This binary image is important in extracting some important features of the image. 

###Using this program 
First of all, we need imput image, these images should be in the same folder as of the code files.
Then run all the file except using_function.m. At the end run file using_function.m.
Here enter the name of image, we can adjust number of image to be displayed at a time with subplot command and using imput command. 
enter the name of the image we will get the image after thesholding.
